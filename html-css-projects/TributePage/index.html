            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>
                 The Wright brothers, Orville and Wilbur, are credited with inventing and building the 
                world’s first successful powered airplane. Their achievement marked the beginning of 
                modern aviation and revolutionized the way humanity traveled and connected. 
            </p>
            <p>
                The story of the Wright brothers, Orville (born 1871) and Wilbur (born 1867), is one 
                of perseverance, scientific inquiry, and ingenuity. They are most famous for their 
                successful flight on December 17, 1903, at Kitty Hawk, North Carolina, but their journey 
                was the result of years of experimentation, learning from both failure and success.

            <h2>The Early Life & Influences</h2>
            <p>
                The Wright brothers grew up in Dayton, Ohio, in a family that valued education and 
                exploration. Their father, Milton Wright, was a bishop in the Church of the United 
                Brethren in Christ and instilled in them a strong sense of curiosity and an interest 
                in science and mechanics. Although neither of them graduated from high school, they shared 
                a passion for learning and were largely self-taught.
            </p>
            <p>
                Their initial interest in flight stemmed from their fascination with birds and the mechanics 
                of flight. As children, they were particularly captivated by a toy helicopter given to them 
                by their father. This toy, which could fly by spinning, ignited their curiosity about the 
                possibilities of powered human flight.

            <h2>The Development of Airplane</h2>
            <p>
                Before the Wright brothers made their breakthrough in powered flight, many others had attempted 
                to create flying machines. However, these efforts had all ended in failure, primarily due to an 
                insufficient understanding of aerodynamics and control. The Wright brothers’ genius lay not only 
                in their ability to build a powered aircraft but also in their understanding of the principles of 
                control and stability.
            </p>
            <p>
                The brothers began their serious work on flight in the late 1890s, drawing inspiration from the 
                work of others, including German engineer Otto Lilienthal, who had made controlled glider flights 
                before his death in 1896. The Wrights understood that a successful airplane needed to address three 
                key challenges: lift, propulsion, and control.

                <p>
                    The Wright brothers built and tested their own wings based on their calculations and Lilienthal’s 
                    work. They also experimented with wing shapes and surface areas to maximize lift, which ultimately 
                    led to the development of an efficient airfoil design.

                <p>
                    They designed and built a lightweight engine specifically for their aircraft. Their attention to 
                    weight and power led to a successful engine design that provided the necessary thrust to propel 
                    their plane.

            <details>
                <summary>Control</summary>
                <p >
                     Most importantly, the Wright brothers developed a system of control that made their airplane stable 
                    in flight. They implemented a three-axis control system—pitch, roll, and yaw—that allowed the pilot 
                    to control the plane in three dimensions. This was a revolutionary development in flight technology.
                </p>
            </details>
            <p>
                The brothers’ careful and methodical approach to these challenges set them apart from previous inventors 
                and laid the foundation for their success.

            <h2>The First Flight</h2>
            <p>
                After years of experimentation with gliders and careful refinement of their designs, the Wright brothers 
                were ready for their first powered flight. On December 17, 1903, at Kill Devil Hills, near Kitty Hawk, 
                North Carolina, Orville piloted the Flyer, a biplane powered by a 12-horsepower engine. The first flight 
                lasted 12 seconds, covering a distance of 120 feet.
            </p>
            <p>
                Over the course of the day, the brothers made several additional flights, with the longest lasting 59 
                seconds and covering 852 feet. Although the flights were short, they demonstrated that powered, 
                controlled flight was possible. The Wright brothers had succeeded where others had failed, combining 
                propulsion, lift, and control in a single machine.

            <h2>Legacy</h2>
            <p>
                The Wright brothers’ successful invention of the airplane had profound implications for the future of 
                transportation, warfare, and global connectivity. Within just a few years of their first flight, 
                aviation was becoming increasingly popular and commercially viable. By 1909, the Wright brothers were 
                performing public exhibitions of their aircraft, drawing attention from governments and military forces 
                around the world.
            </p>
            <p>
                World War I accelerated the development and use of airplanes for reconnaissance, bombing, and 
                dogfighting. The Wright brothers' invention became integral to military strategies and the global 
                conflict. Aviation also revolutionized civilian transportation, leading to the development of airlines 
                and faster, more efficient ways of moving people and goods across the globe.
